# About Us

## About Reproduce.AI
ReproduceAI provides consultancy and professional service to help customers in adopting the latest state of the art AI technologies. We have in-depth knowledge and experiences to address every aspect of how machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can be useful to solve business problems. We harness data, design and improve state of the art ML/DL models to give clarity on how AI can improve organization performance. 

## Our Values
Reproducing and implementing current state of the art AI models are very hard to do for enterprises and startups. The main reasons are technical complexities and rapid development of the ML/DL field itself. Despite the fact that we have AI use cases and proven models in many domains (eq. vision, speech and NLU), it takes too long to gain organization performance, especially without enough experts in the team. 

Our mission is to unlock the AI research achievements and make it ready for rapid implementation in both enterprises and startups. We are an experimental team consisting of AI research engineers and data scientists with in-depth experiences in multi-paradigm AI modeling, including discriminative, generative and reinforcement learning. We work to help customers in understanding their data, select potential AI use cases, review the latest state of the art ML/DL models and reproduce the codes for continuous improvements. 

- **Business Impact.** AI is technology to improve productivity by learning from data and augment people capability.  Business impact is at the center of everything we do. Our multidisciplinary expert team will help customers to achieve that goal.

- **Cutting Edge.** ML/DL is a rapidly changing dynamic field of technology. To take advantage of AI, it is critically important to be on the edge and continuously improve based on state of the art (SOTA) research achievements. We absorb the complexities, simplify and give clarity for our customers.

- **Multi-Paradigm**. We believe that AI = Data + Codes (Model + Algorithm) that can be defined using many paradigms, scientific disciplines and techniques. We help our customers to understand the most fundamental concepts in ML/DL and provide practical implementation guidance.

- **Trusted Partnership**. Data is a key asset in modern organization and trust is the currency of our engagement with customers. We strive with the highest levels of data curation, governance and information security with our customers. It is critically important for us as a trusted partner. 

## Core Competencies
We continuously build and improve our core competencies in cutting-edge ML/DL modeling within the following paradigms: 

- **Discriminative Models.** Class of AI models used for classification and regression which work to distinguish decision boundaries through observed data. A discriminative model learns conditional probability distribution to predict output from a given input.  

- **Generative Models**. Class of AI models used for generating new data from observed data. Given observable variables and a target variable, generative models learn the joint probability distribution between observable and target variables. 

- **Reinforcement Learning**. Class of AI models concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. 

## Professional Services
We provide professional services to help customers in normalizing, democratizing and adopting the state of the art ML/DL models. 

- **Technical Consultancy.** For us, AI = Data + Codes (Model + Algorithm). We provide in-depth consultancy service to help customers on understanding data, perform exploratory analysis and select proper ML/DL model and algorithm.

- **Advance Training Services**. Based on customer requirements, we provide advanced technical training to learn specific ML/DL models. We review the latest SOTA models for the required use cases, conceptualize, reproduce and deliver in-class training.

- **AI Model Development Service**. Once data and AI models are identified, we provide professional service to develop code assets as baseline for future improvement. Our standard codes are reusable and easy to understand. We also provide guidance to deploy ML/DL models as cloud API, both for on-premises and on-cloud infrastructures.

## Current Portfolios
- **Healthcare.** ReproduceAI is a trusted partner of Indonesia Medical Education and Research Institute (IMERI) and UMG IdeaLab. 

- **HR Analytic.** ReproduceAI is empowering ANDAL Software to develop and deploy people analytic services from HR dataset. 

- **Finance.** ReproduceAI is a trusted partner of Algolab Investama to develop and deploy QuantEngine for stock trading. 

- **EduTech.** ReproduceAI is a trusted partner of Aksaramaya Group to develop and deploy intelligent services for the education sector.
